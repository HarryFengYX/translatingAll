# translatingAll
To translate multiple English words to Chinese at same time
Currently have a small search bar, which I tried to enlarge but failed due to the complexity of Tkinker (is there a spelling mistake?) module.
There are some requirements: python3, bs4, and Tkinter.
I have been tranforming it to multi-versional, but you know, still working on that.

Using this program:
There are two general ways:
First one:
  Click UI.py, and in theory, it will pop a small UI window where you can type words into, separated by spaces. When you finish typing, hit Enter, the search will begin. Just hold a while and you will see a window pop up telling all your translations. But this cannot be copied, therefore if you want to copy this, you will have to go the the "translated" file, and you will find what you just translated, but there might be small lags.
Second:
  python3 vocabulary_processor
  Then what happens I forget, but it should be intuitive :)
