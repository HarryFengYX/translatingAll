			<concept name="market">
				<definition>A market is a place, physical or virtual, where buyers and sellers of goods and services meet to make an exchange.</definition>
				<examples>Physical markets: exchanged for money. Virtual [on-line] markets: by credit cardsftmoney transfers, traded via computers. Or Product markets. Factor [resource] markets: landftlabourftcapitalftentrepreneurship market. Financial markets: foreign exchange market, stock markets. Or Localftnationalftinternational markets</examples>
			</concept>
			<concept name="competitive market">
				<definition>Competitive market is the market for a good with large numbers of buyers and sellers, where the single seller has very little or no market power. Competitive markets bring diversity of goods, efficiencies, and generally greater wealth for all.</definition>
			</concept>
			<concept name="market structures">
				<examples>Perfect competition: if there are a large number of firms producing identical products facing identical production costs and in which there are no barriers to entry or exit. Monopolistic competition: if there are many firms producing differentiated products and in which there are no barriers to entry or exit. Oligopoly: if a few sellers dominate the market for an identical or differentiated good, and there are significant barriers to entry. Monopoly: if one firm dominates the market for a good that has no substitutes and where significant barriers to entry exist.</examples>
			</concept>
			<concept name="demand">
				<definition>Demand is the quantity of a good or service that consumers are willing and able to buy at a given price in a given time period.</definition>

				<other_determinants>5. Taxftsubsidy 6. Expectation of future 7. Income distribution 8. Number of potential buyers 9. Seasonal changes.</other_determinants>
			</concept>
			<concept name="law of demand">
				<definition>The Law of Demand states that as the price of a good increases, the quantity demanded of the good decreases, ceteris paribus.</definition>
				<explanation>There is a negative causal relationship bftt price [P] and quantity demanded [Qd].</explanation>
				<reasons>1. Income effect: p falls, real income rise. 2. Substitution effect: p falls, switch from substituted. 3. Law of diminishing marginal utility: less utility</reasons>
			</concept>

			</concept>
			<concept name="substitute">
				<definition>A substitute good [substitute] is one which can be used in place of each other, so demand for one will  increase when the price of another good increases. Substitute goods have positive cross price elasticity.</definition>
			</concept>
			<concept name="complementary good">
				<definition>Complementary goods [complements] are goods used in combination with each other [consumed together], so demand for one will decrease when the price of the other increases. Complementary goods have negative cross price elasticity.</definition>

			</concept>
			<concept name="law of supply">
				<definition>The law of supply states that as the price of a good increases, the quantity supplied of good increases, ceteris paribus.</definition>
				<explanation>There is a positive causal relationship between price and quantity supplied.</explanation>
				<reasons>At higher prices there will be more potential profits to be made and so the producer will increase output.</reasons>
			</concept>
			<concept name="joint supply">
				<definition>Joint supply is goods which are produced together, or where the production of one good involves the production of another product, e.g. meat and leather.</definition>

			<concept name="market equilibrium">
				<definition>Market equilibrium is the point where quantity demanded is equal to quantity supplied. This creates market clearing price and quantity where there is no excess demand or excess supply.</definition>
			</concept>
			<concept name="equilibrium price">

				<definition>Excess supply [surplus] is where quantity supplied is greater than quantity demanded. It occurs where the price of a good is higher than the equilibrium price.</definition>
			</concept>
			<concept name="price mechanism">
				<definition>Price mechanism is the forces of demand and supply, i.e. market forces. It is the means to allocate resources through demand and supply in a market arriving at an equilibrium price. Prices act as a signal and an incentive to producers and consumers to produceftconsume more or less</definition>
				<function>P has a signalling function and an incentive function, which result in a reallocation of resources when Ps change as a result of a change in DftS conditions.</function>

			<concept name="income elasticity of demand">
				<definition>Income elasticity of demand [YED] is the measure of the responsiveness of demand [and hence a shifting demand curve] for a good to a change in consumers income.</definition>
				<determinants>1. normal or inferior 2. necessity or luxury</determinants>
				<application>YED for producers [business] and economy [govts]:-  Primary products have a relatively low YED-  Manufactured products have a relatively higher YED -  Services have an even higher YED</application>
				<applicaiton>Firms can use YED to help plan their investments.-  economy is growing: firms producing income-elastic products should expand capacity to meet foreseeable growing D in near future.eg potatoes farmers may think of switching to kiwi fruit or agro-tourism which have a higher YED.-  economy in recession: firms producing inferior goods should get prepared for rising D</applicaiton>
				<application>Govts can use YED to plan in advance training for their workforce [or displaced workers] to suit the changing needs.A fast growing economy may suffer from structural U. Income-inelastic sectors will shrink in LR, and highly income-elastic sectors will grow fast.eg income-elastic tourism firms will expand more rapidly and govts should plan ahead some changes in school curricula and vocational training.</application>
				<application>Implications for economies with different emphasis:-  Primary products: low YED, relatively stable D. Producers do not benefit much from growth of national incomes, but sales are also less affected by a recession.Strategies: producers may reap greater gains during e. growth by increasing value added of their products, eg processing coffeeftcocoa and producing ground coffeeft chocolate.  -  Manufactured goods: high YED, more volatile D. Producers will benefit from e. growth, but sales are also affected by a recession.-  Services: very high YED, very volatile D [subject to large fluctuations in e. growth]. Producers will benefit a lot from e. growth, but sales are also seriously affected by a recession. Strategies: service providers may protect themselves against e. downturns through diversification. eg, intl banks often expand operations into different parts of world to reduce reliance on a few markets.</application>

			</concept>
			<concept name="evaluation of subsidy">
				<evaluations>1. OC of G on a subsidy: other alternative G projects. 2."Who is paying taxes?" While a subsidy allow consumers to buy goods at a lower price, they are also taxpayers who fund subsidy. 3. Debate in interna]onal trade: whether subsidy allow firms to be inefficient, if they do not have to compete with foreign producers? What damage will it do to foreign producers who do not receive subsidies from their government? E.g. high-income countries give billions of dollars of subsidies to their farmers, leading to over-production and damaging to small-scale farmers in developing countries. Since farmers in developing countries do not receive subsidies from their government and have to compete with low prices of high-income country farmers who do receive subsidies.</evaluations>
